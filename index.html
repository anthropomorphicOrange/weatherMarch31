          Los Angeles has a two-season Mediterranean climate of dry summer and
          very mild winter, but it receives less annual precipitation than most
          other Mediterranean climates, so it is near the boundary of a
          semi-arid climate, though narrowly missing it. Daytime temperatures
          are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around
          68 °F (20 °C) giving it a tropical feel although it is a few degrees
          too cool to be a true tropical climate on average due to cool night
          temperatures. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year,
          with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation
          annually.

          Located in the Great Plains far from the moderating influence of
          mountains or large bodies of water, Lincoln has a highly variable four
          season humid continental climate: winters are cold and summers are
          hot. With little precipitation during winter, precipitation is
          concentrated in the warmer months, when thunderstorms frequently roll
          in, often producing tornadoes. Snow averages 26.0 inches (66 cm) per
          season. Snow tends to fall in light amounts, though blizzards are
          possible. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 7
          thru April 25, allowing a growing season of 164 days.

          New York City features a humid subtropical climate and is thus the
          northernmost major city on the North American continent with this
          categorization. The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the
          transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental
          climates. The city is defined as having an oceanic climate.
          Temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times per winter,
          yet can also reach 60 °F (16 °C) for several days even in the coldest
          winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from
          cool to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity.
          Summers are typically hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of
          77.5 °F (25.3 °C) in July.
